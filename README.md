# How to Run

Set up the server.
Update the server URL in the `constants.js` file and `App.js` file.
Update the `ID` in `constants.js` file (Make a dummy data on the server side and copy the generated ID here)

Now you can use the app to update your Profile Picture and add a new Story.

You can see the screen pictures and a video showing the working app [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fVamEqz_CFSuHFSZO1DgLawjAEdzftkJ?usp=sharing)
